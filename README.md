# A-Ecosystem

is a digital laboratory where simple agents evolve to survive. These 'robots'
compete for limited resources and, upon gathering enough energy, pass their
genetic traits to the next generation.

This project showcases how, from a simple set of rules —genetic diversity 
and natural selection— a complex ecosystem arises, complete with distinct
survival strategies, evolutionary trade-offs, and dynamic population cycles.
