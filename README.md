# A-Ecosystem

is a digital laboratory where simple agents evolve to survive. These 'robots'
compete for limited resources and, upon gathering enough energy, pass their
genetic traits to the next generation.

This project showcases how, from a simple set of rules —genetic diversity 
and natural selection— a complex ecosystem arises, complete with distinct
survival strategies, evolutionary trade-offs, and dynamic population cycles.

# How did I get the idea
About 5 years ago, while I was trying learn any AI stuff on YouTube, I found a video of a type of artificial
ecosystem, where a bug tried to eat and reproduce. I was thrilled by it, and, as a 15 year old boy, i naively
thought it would be an easy project to base myself on to make my own. Oh, how wrong I was.

Back then, I had no idea about what classes were, I tried to do everything in one giant
function that returned a list of atributes, and every operation meant that I had to work inside
that list (I didn't know how to use dictionaries). Needless to say... That project flopped as soon
as I tried to add a new feature.

But as I got to study CS (and finally learnt about OOP by having Java as the only language I could use),
I finally felt I had enough skills to get over this project. 

So when I got a week off, I started working on this...
I finished the first final version in 6 hours, and I think I watched a movie and ate around that time,
so it was less than that.

I mean, I thought it would take me longer, it had to... I didn't wait 5 years just to finish it in less
 than a day, right?

Well. After the code was done, I tried to graph the simulation's data, just so that I could have some 
more info, maybe for a school presentation. That's when I discovered the project's true depth: the 
unpredictability of the environment, how it behaved like a real population, and the realization
that this was anything but a simple project.

# Characteristics

- **Evolution by Natural Selection**:
    The robots live, eat, reproduce, and die. If they don't eat,
    they can't reproduce.

- **Genetics for movement and vision**:
    Every bot has a genome that defines their behavior

- **Dynamic Ecosystem**:
    The population of food and bots fluctuates, generating cycles of abundance and scarcity.

- **Data analysis**:
    The simulation generates .csv files ready to be analyzed. You can use the integrated plotter,
    or any tool you want to use.

- **Real-time visualization**:
    Using pygame, you can watch the simulation as it happens!
